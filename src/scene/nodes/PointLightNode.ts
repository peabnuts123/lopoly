   * How far this light propagates in space.
   * Light falloff is a quadratic equation with no fixed limit/cutoff, so this property
   * represents the distance at which the light's intensity will be at 10%.
   *
   * The equation for a point light's intensity is the classic OpenGL lighting attenuation equation:
   * ```
   * 1 / (K_c + K_l * d + K_q * d^2)
   * ```
   *
   * Where:
   *  - `K_c` is the Constant coefficient
   *  - `K_l` is the Linear coefficient
   *  - `K_q` is the Quadratic coefficient
   *  - `d` is the distance from the light source
   *
   * In LoPoly's lighting model:
   *  - `K_c` = 1
   *  - `K_l` = 0
   *  - `K_q` = `((1 / L) - 1) / r^2`
   *    - `L` = Lighting intensity at max range = 0.1
   *    - `r` = `range` parameter of light
   *    - This ensures that at distance `r` the intensity will be `L`
