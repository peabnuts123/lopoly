### Concepts

LoPoly games are assembled from a small hierarchy of concepts:
  - [Engine](#engine) `(1)`
    - [Scene](#scene) `(0..*)`
      - [SceneNode](#scene-nodes) `(0..*)`
        - [SceneNode](#scene-nodes) `(0..*)`
          - ...

The {@link Engine.Engine Engine} has many {@link scene/Scene.Scene Scenes}, each of which contain a hierarchy of many {@link scene/SceneNode.SceneNode SceneNodes}. If you have any experience with Godot, this should feel pretty familiar - except for the differentiation between scenes (levels / scenes) and scene nodes (the objects within a scene).

LoPoly uses a Right-Handed, Z-up coordinate system. The benefits of this are:
  - When implementing movement (e.g. player movement), you don't need to negate one of the input axes (e.g. `X=X`, `Y=-Y` as seen in RH Y-up or LH Z-up)
  - When using 2D vectors (such as input from a controller), XY can be mapped directly to XY in 3 dimensions (don't have to map `X=X` `Z=Y` as seen in LH Y-up)

#### Engine

{@link Engine.Engine Engine} is the top-level object. It contains all the logic for running the game, and is in charge of the run loop.

An engine is created from 2 things:
  - A `<canvas>` instance
  - An {@link filesystem/IFileSystem.IFileSystem IFileSystem} instance

The canvas is the HTMLCanvasElement that will be used to render the game. Style and position this element to display your game somewhere on the page. The canvas also dictates the resolution at which your game runs (through `width` and `height` HTML attributes).

The file system is an abstract interface that tells the engine how to access all the code and assets for your game. See [file systems](#file-systems) for more information.

#### File systems

{@link filesystem/IFileSystem.IFileSystem IFileSystem} is an abstract interface that lets LoPoly access the data for your game. A default {@link filesystem/WebFileSystem.WebFileSystem WebFileSystem} is provided that lets LoPoly read resources from web urls (e.g. `/models/player.glb` reads from `https://foo.com/models/player.glb`).

This allows you to serve LoPoly games from different sources e.g. from a web domain, from memory, from [Tauri's file system plugin](https://v2.tauri.app/plugin/file-system/), etc.

#### Scene

A scene is best thought of as a "level" or "screen" within your game. Only one scene can be loaded at a time. A scene contains a hierarchy of [SceneNodes](#scene-nodes) which make up all the objects and behaviours for your game.

**Note** that in LoPoly - unlike Godot - scenes cannot contain other scenes.

#### Scene nodes

A {@link scene/SceneNode.SceneNode SceneNode} is any node in the hierarchy within a scene. There are many types of scene node:
- {@link scene/nodes/ModelNode.ModelNode ModelNode}
- {@link scene/nodes/CameraNode.CameraNode CameraNode}
- {@link scene/nodes/PointLightNode.PointLightNode PointLightNode}
- {@link scene/nodes/BoxColliderNode.BoxColliderNode BoxColliderNode}
- {@link scene/nodes/AudioSourceNode.AudioSourceNode AudioSourceNode}
- etc.

Scene nodes have a {@link transform/Transform.Transform Transform} (i.e. position, rotation, scale) as well as children. Scene nodes inherit their parent's transform (e.g. moving the parent also moves the child).

When accessing a scene node's transform, you will note two versions of each property e.g.
  - {@link transform/Transform.Transform.position position}
  - {@link transform/Transform.Transform.absolutePosition absolutePosition}

Both properties are mutable. The absolute property (e.g. {@link transform/Transform.Transform.absolutePosition absolutePosition}) references the property irrespective of the hierarchy (e.g. the node's actual position within the scene), whereas the other property (e.g. {@link transform/Transform.Transform.position position}) references the property local to its parent (e.g. the node's position relative to its parent).

**Note** that, unlike Unity, nodes don't have "components" or any other attributes. Rather, "game objects" are composed of hierarchies of different nodes.

### Getting started

Getting started is simple. The core primitive to LoPoly is an {@link Engine.Engine Engine}:


```html
<!-- index.html -->
<!-- Size and style the canvas how you like -->
<canvas
  tabindex="0"
  id="game"
  width="480"
  height="360"
  class="[image-rendering:pixelated] w-full touch-none select-none"
></canvas>
```

```typescript
/* index.ts */
const canvas = document.getElementById('game') as HTMLCanvasElement;
const fileSystem = new WebFileSystem();
const engine = new Engine(canvas, fileSystem);
```

Creating an {@link Engine.Engine Engine} needs a canvas element and a file system from which to read assets. You can use {@link filesystem/WebFileSystem.WebFileSystem WebFileSystem} to serve your game's assets from a web server.

From there you can create a {@link scene/Scene.Scene Scene}:

```typescript
const scene = new Scene(engine);
```

Before you can populate the scene, you will need to load any assets you will be using:

```typescript
const playerModelDefinition = await GltfLoader.loadModel('/models/plat.glb', fileSystem);
const playerModel = await Model.fromDefinition(engine, playerModelDefinition);
```

Models are first loaded as a "definition" before being created into an actual model asset. See [Loading assets](#models) more details on this.

Now you can populate the scene:

```typescript
// Player model
const player = new ModelNode(scene, 'player', playerModel);

// Camera - position at (1,1,1) and point at the player
const camera = new CameraNode(scene, 'camera', 70, 4 / 3);
camera.position.setValue(1, 1, 1);
camera.pointAt(player.position);

// Sun light shining at a steep angle
const sun = new DirectionalLightNode(scene, 'sun');
sun.rotation.x = -70;
```

The last thing to add is a call to {@link Engine.Engine.run Engine.run()} to start the game:

```typescript
engine.run((dt) => {
  // Slowly rotate the player character
  player.rotation.z += 25 * dt;
});
```

{@link Engine.Engine.run Engine.run()} takes a callback that is executed once per frame. This callback is passed a few parameters:
- `dt`
  - The number of **seconds** passed since the previous frame
  - Use this parameter to write logic that is independent of the framerate
- `time`
  - The number of **seconds** passed since the start of the game i.e. since {@link Engine.Engine.run Engine.run()}
  - Use this parameter to write logic that would normally keep a sum of `dt` e.g. animating something with {@link math/util.cos cos}
- `stop`
  - Stop the game application

You may also implement your loops in a more robust / isolated manner by creating custom classes that inherit from {@link scene/SceneNode.SceneNode SceneNode}. Through this architecture, you can let objects manage their own loop:

```typescript
class Player extends ModelNode {
  private readonly speed = 2;

  // `onUpdate()` is automatically called by Engine
  public override onUpdate(dt: number): void {
    const moveInput = new Vector2(
      this.input.getAxisValue('player:x'),
      this.input.getAxisValue('player:y'),
    ).normalizeSelf();

    this.position.addSelf(moveInput.scaleSelf(this.speed * dt));
  }

  // Scene and Engine are available properties on SceneNode
  public get input(): IInputSystem { return this.scene.engine.inputSystem; }
}
```

Writing your entire game's code in {@link Engine.Engine.run Engine.run()} is mostly useful only for small concepts or ideas. Implementing your own meaningful classes for your game objects is the more scalable and preferred approach.

Here is the full code sample for a simple game in LoPoly:

```typescript
import { Engine } from "@lopoly/engine/Engine";
import { WebFileSystem } from "@lopoly/engine/filesystem";
import { GltfLoader } from "@lopoly/engine/loaders/GltfLoader";
import { Model } from "@lopoly/engine/models";
import { Scene } from "@lopoly/engine/scene";
import { CameraNode, DirectionalLightNode, ModelNode } from "@lopoly/engine/scene/nodes";

const canvas = document.getElementById('game') as HTMLCanvasElement;

// Setup
const fileSystem = new WebFileSystem();
const engine = new Engine(canvas, fileSystem);
const scene = new Scene(engine);

// Load assets
const playerModelDefinition = await GltfLoader.loadModel('/models/plat.glb', fileSystem);
const playerModel = await Model.fromDefinition(engine, playerModelDefinition);

// Scene
const player = new ModelNode(scene, 'player', playerModel);

const camera = new CameraNode(scene, 'camera', 70, 4 / 3);
camera.position.setValue(1, 1, 1);
camera.pointAt(player.position);

const sun = new DirectionalLightNode(scene, 'sun');
sun.rotation.x = -70;

engine.run((dt) => {
  player.rotation.z += 25 * dt;
});
```

### Loading assets

All assets are loaded through the engine's [file system](#file-systems). Different types of assets are loaded through different classes.

#### Models

LoPoly supports loading the following 3D model formats:
  - [glTF](https://github.com/khronosgroup/gltf) (`.glb` or `.gltf` + external resources)
    - Use  {@link loaders/GltfLoader.GltfLoader.loadModel GltfLoader.loadModel(path, fileSystem)}
  - [Wavefront OBJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file)
    - Use {@link loaders/ObjLoader.ObjLoader.loadModel ObjLoader.loadModel(path, fileSystem)}

Loading a model reads the file format and returns a {@link loaders/definitions/model.ModelDefinition ModelDefinition}. A model definition is an in-memory representation of the geometry, animations and materials contained within a model asset.

A model definition cannot be used directly. It must first be loaded into a {@link models/Model.Model Model} using {@link models/Model.Model.fromDefinition Model.fromDefinition()}. This separation exists for a few reasons:
- Allow editing of a model definition before it is loaded (e.g. to add more capabilities, such as vertex colors)
- Allow selective sharing of model modifications and overrides between many {@link scene/nodes/ModelNode.ModelNode ModelNode} instances (e.g. loading a model twice to make "red" and "blue" versions)


Example of loading and displaying a 3D model asset:

```typescript
// Read file from file system
const playerModelDefinition = await GltfLoader.loadModel('/models/player.glb', fileSystem);
// Create model asset from definition
const playerModel = await Model.fromDefinition(engine, playerModelDefinition);
// Display model in the scene
const player = new ModelNode(scene, 'player', playerModel);
```

[Read more](#models-1) about using models in LoPoly.

#### Audio

Loading audio clips is simple:

```typescript
const playerJumpClip = await AudioClip.load(engine, '/audio/player_jump.wav');
```

Support for different formats is based on the user's browser. See [MDN's guide on audio codecs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats/Audio_codecs) or [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/?search=audio+format) for more information. You can generally expect support for common audio formats like:
- WAV
- MP3
- AAC (MP4)
- FLAC
- OGG
- Opus

Example of loading and playing an audio clip:

```typescript
// Load audio clip from file system
const playerJumpClip = await AudioClip.load(engine, '/audio/player_jump.wav');
// Create audio source in the scene
const audioSource = new AudioSourceNode(scene, 'player:audio');
// Play clip from audio source
audioSource.playClip(playerJumpClip);
```

[Read more](#audio-1) about playing audio in LoPoly.

#### Textures and Cubemaps

Textures can be loaded as follows:

```typescript
const playerRed = await Texture.load(engine, '/textures/player_red.png');
```

Cubemaps are a type of 3D texture used in reflections and skyboxes. Cubemaps can be loaded similarly:

```typescript
const skybox = await Cubemap.loadBoxNet(engine, '/textures/cubemaps/skybox.png');
```

Cubemaps require specific layouts in the source image asset (e.g. `boxNet`). See {@link textures/Cubemap.Cubemap Cubemap} for more details.

Support for different formats is based on the user's browser. See [MDN's guide on image formats](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats/Image_types) for more information. You can generally expect support for common image formats like:
- JPEG
- PNG
- GIF
- WebP
- AVIF
- etc.

Example of loading and using a Texture and a Cubemap:

```typescript
// Load texture + cubemap
const playerRed = await Texture.load(engine, '/textures/player_red.png');
const skybox = await Cubemap.loadBoxNet(engine, '/textures/cubemaps/skybox.png');
// Use in a material override
playerModel.setMaterialOverride('player', new Material({
  diffuseTexture: playerRed,
  reflectionCubemap: skybox,
}));
```

[Read more](#materials) about using materials in LoPoly.

### Models

Models are the primary way of displaying 3D graphics. Models are loaded from assets in a file system (see documentation on [loading models](#models)).

```typescript
// Read file from file system
const playerModelDefinition = await GltfLoader.loadModel('/models/player.glb', fileSystem);
// Create model asset from definition
const playerModel = await Model.fromDefinition(engine, playerModelDefinition);
```

A {@link models/Model.Model Model} instance stores all the geometry, [materials](#materials), and [animations](#animations) of a 3D asset. Models are comprised of a hierarchy of {@link models/ModelPart.ModelPart ModelPart} objects, which may be comprised of many {@link models/MeshPrimitive.MeshPrimitive MeshPrimitive} objects.

```
Model -> (0..*) ModelPart -> (0..*) MeshPrimitive
```

Model parts can be transformed separately to create different poses and animations. Furthermore, a model part may also define a {@link models/MeshSkin.MeshSkin MeshSkin} to deform its mesh primitives based on other model parts (e.g. to transform a character model based on "bones").

### Animations

> **NOTE:** Animation in LoPoly is currently in an early MVP state. All animations are looped, and stopping an animation does not reset the model back to any kind of rest pose. Its recommended for now that you implement an `idle` animation to play when the model should stop animating.

Animations are stored as a set of keyframes containing transform changes for model parts over time (e.g. `at 0.6 seconds, part 'arm.r' should have rotation '0, 0.1, 0.23, 0.8'`). Animations are loaded as part of a model, not as a separate asset.


You can play an animation on a {@link scene/nodes/ModelNode.ModelNode ModelNode} like so:

```typescript
// Create ModelNode instance
const player = new ModelNode(scene, 'player', playerModel);
// Play animation
player.playAnimation('idle');
```

#### Sharing animations

You can use the animations from one model to animate another (so-called "animation retargeting"), though no attempt is made to ensure the animations are appropriate for the target model. This is useful for e.g. sharing common animations with skeletons that have been designed for them.

```typescript
// Load a common 'animation rig' model containing many common animations (e.g. idle, run, jump, etc.)
const animationRig = await Model.fromDefinition(engine, animationRigDefinition);

// Create player model node - use animation rig as source for animations
const player = new ModelNode(scene, 'player', playerModel);
player.animationSource = animationRig;
player.playAnimation('run');
```

Animations target model parts by name, so the skeleton/hierarchy has to match between the source and target models.

### Materials

Individual {@link models/MeshPrimitive.MeshPrimitive MeshPrimitives} are drawn using a single {@link materials/Material.Material Material}. Materials in LoPoly have a few simple properties:
- Diffuse color
  - A {@link math/Color4.Color4 Color4} "tint" applied to the mesh primitive
  - Multiplied with vertex color and diffuse texture
- Diffuse texture
  - A {@link textures/Texture.Texture Texture} to apply to the mesh primitive based on the vertices' texture coordinates
  - Multiplied with vertex color and diffuse color
- Blending mode
  - A {@link materials/ShaderBlendingMode.ShaderBlendingMode:var ShaderBlendingMode} specifying how each transparent pixel of the mesh primitive is written into the draw buffer. Since transparent materials are drawn after opaque materials, the blending mode specifies how the mesh primitive is "blended" with the data already in the draw buffer
  - **NOTE:** Opaque pixels ALWAYS overwrite the draw buffer (i.e. are NOT blended)
  - There are several blending modes:
    - **None**: All pixels are drawn directly to / overwrite the buffer (opaque)
    - **Average**: Transparent pixels are averaged with the contents of the draw buffer
    - **Additive**: Transparent pixels are added to the contents of the draw buffer
    - **Subtractive**: Transparent pixels are subtracted from the contents of the draw buffer
    - **AlphaBlend**: Transparent pixels are combined with the contents of the draw buffer based on the pixel's alpha value (i.e. 0x00 = Fully transparent, 0xFF = Fully opaque)
    - **AlphaClip**: Pixels either overwrite the draw buffer or are discarded based on whether their alpha value is above or below some threshold. NOTE that this makes `AlphaClip` an OPAQUE blending mode (see {@link materials/ShaderBlendingMode.ShaderBlendingMode:var ShaderBlendingMode} for more details)
- Unlit
  - Whether lighting should be ignored when drawing the mesh primitive
- Reflection cubemap
  - A {@link textures/Cubemap.Cubemap Cubemap} to render as a reflection on the surface of the mesh primitive
- Reflection cubemap intensity
  - How visible the reflection is, if specified
<!-- - @TODO Reflection blending mode -->

### Collision handling

LoPoly has a simple collision handling system that can detect and resolve collisions between a few types of shapes:
  - Box ({@link scene/nodes/BoxColliderNode.BoxColliderNode BoxColliderNode})
    - A box with x/y/z dimensions. Does not have to be axis-aligned.
  - Convex mesh ({@link scene/nodes/ConvexMeshColliderNode.ConvexMeshColliderNode ConvexMeshColliderNode})
    - Any convex shape (specified via a {@link models/Model.Model Model}). A mesh is "convex" if any line passing through it can only intersect the shape once or, in other terms, any shape whose interior angles are all less than 180°

#### Collision groups

All colliders have a "collision group" which is a number between 0 (inclusive) and {@link collision/CollisionSystem.CollisionSystem.MaxCollisionGroups CollisionSystem.MaxCollisionGroups} (exclusive - 32 by default). Collision groups are used to specify which colliders can interact. For example, if the player, monsters, and platforms all have different collision groups, one could specify that players can jump on platforms, but monsters cannot.

Configuring the interactions between collision groups is done through the {@link collision/CollisionSystem.CollisionSystem CollisionSystem} instance on {@link Engine.IEngine.collisionSystem IEngine.collisionSystem}:

```typescript
const { collisionSystem } = engine;
// Specify that collision groups 0 and 1 cannot interact
collisionSystem.setInteraction(0, 1, false);

// Check whether two groups can interact
collisionSystem.canInteract(0, 1); // Returns `false`
```

#### Using colliders

Colliders are scene nodes just like anything else. Constructing them is simple:

```typescript
const playerCollisionGroup = 0;
const playerCollider = new BoxColliderNode(scene, 'player:collider', playerCollisionGroup, { x: 30, y: 30, z: 70 });
```

Colliders have a function called {@link scene/nodes/ColliderNode.ColliderNode.move move()} that can compute a movement and apply it to a target. For example:

```typescript
// Create player object
const player = new ModelNode(scene, 'player', playerModel);
// Create collider as child of player
const playerCollider = new BoxColliderNode(scene, 'player:collider', 0, { x: 30, y: 30, z: 70 }, player);
// Compute the movement (0, 5, 0) and apply the result to `player`
playerCollider.move(player, new Vector3(0, 5, 0));
```

When calling {@link scene/nodes/ColliderNode.ColliderNode.move move(target, vector)}, the collider attempts to move by `vector`, resolving any collisions that may occur as a result of this movement, and then applies this result to `target`. Collisions are resolved using a "minimum translation vector" which produces a "sliding" effect when colliders intersect. You can also call {@link scene/nodes/ColliderNode.ColliderNode.computeMove computeMove(vector)} which just does the calculation and returns the result, without applying it to anything.

### Audio

LoPoly features a simple but robust system for playing audio. There are three main components:
  - The {@link audio/AudioSystem.AudioSystem AudioSystem} itself (a singleton stored on Engine)
  - {@link audio/AudioClip.AudioClip AudioClips} - individual sounds
  - {@link scene/nodes/AudioSourceNode.AudioSourceNode AudioSourceNode} instances - scene nodes used to play audio

Audio clips are assets loaded from a file system and played through audio source nodes:

```typescript
// Load audio clip
const playerJumpSound = await AudioClip.load(engine, '/audio/player/jump.wav');
// Create source node
const playerAudioSource = new AudioSourceNode(scene, 'player:audio', player);

// ... (later, in the game loop)
if (inputSystem.wasButtonPressed('jump')) {
  playerAudioSource.playClip(playerJumpSound);
}
```

All audio source nodes are 3D by default and will pan audio left/right based on the their direction from the camera. Playing audio is also attenuated based on distance. You can set min and max ranges to control how volume fades out over distance:

```typescript
// Any audio closer than 10 units will play at max volume
playerAudioSource.minRange = 10;
// Audio will fade out to 0% volume by this distance
playerAudioSource.maxRange = 50;
```

Audio source nodes can also be configured to be "global" - playing all audio at the same volume everywhere - by setting the {@link scene/nodes/AudioSourceNode.AudioSourceNode.global global} property:

```typescript
const musicSource = new AudioSourceNode(scene, 'music');
musicSource.global = true;
```

This is useful for e.g. background music.

#### Audio channels and priority

The audio system has a finite number of audio "channels" (24 by default). A vacant audio channel is required to play an audio clip. If no channels are free, the requested audio clip must either be dropped or replace a playing clip. A playing clip will be replaced if its priority is **less than or equal to** that of the requested audio clip. The playing clip with the lowest priority will be replaced, or the clip that has been playing the longest if there is a tie. If the requested audio clip has a lower priority than every playing clip, it will be dropped and not played. An audio channel becomes free as soon as a playing clip stops.

Audio clips are played with a priority of `0` by default. You can specify the priority of an audio clip when it is played (negative priorities are allowed):
```typescript
playerAudioSource.playClip(playerJumpSound, { priority: 2 });
```

The number of audio channels can be customised in the {@link Engine.Engine Engine} constructor configuration:
```typescript
// Set the number of audio channels to 40 (default: 24)
const engine = new Engine(canvas, fileSystem, {
  audio: {
    numChannels: 40,
  }
});
```

#### Controlling audio speed / pitch

> **Note:** Currently speed and pitch are tied together. Playing a clip at a faster speed will play it at a higher pitch. In the future, these two properties will ideally be decoupled. This is a [limitation of the default functionality in the Web Audio API](https://github.com/WebAudio/web-audio-api/issues/2487). This can be worked around, but it requires implementing custom audio processing.

Audio clips can be played at different speeds / pitches:
```typescript
// Play at 200% speed
playerAudioSource.playClip(playerJumpSound, { speed: 2 });
```

You can also specify a speed range to randomly pick a speed in the interval `[speed - speedRange, speed + speedRange)`:

```typescript
// Play clip between 150% (inclusive) and 200% (exclusive) speed
playerAudioSource.playClip(playerWalkSound, { speed: 2, speedRange: 0.5 });
```

This is useful for making audio clips sound less repetitive (e.g. footsteps, gun shots, etc).

### Lighting

While many early 3D games did not support dynamic lighting (relying instead on vertex colors for static lighting), LoPoly supports a simple dynamic lighting system for more easily achieving common effects. Lighting is implemented as simple vertex-based Gouraud shading with ambient + diffuse components (no specular highlights).

LoPoly supports 2 types of lights:

- [Point lights](#point-lights)
- [Directional lights](#directional-lights)

Each light type has a maximum number of lights. Lights created in excess of the max will be inert i.e. they won't be considered as part of the lighting system. See [Config](#config) for more details.



#### Point lights
Point lights can be added to a scene with {@link scene/nodes/PointLightNode.PointLightNode PointLightNode}. Point lights emit light in all directions equally. They have the following properties:
  - {@link scene/nodes/PointLightNode.PointLightNode.color color}
    - The color of the light.
  - {@link scene/nodes/PointLightNode.PointLightNode.intensity intensity}
    - Scalar multiplier for the light's brightness between 0 and 1.
  - {@link scene/nodes/PointLightNode.PointLightNode.range range}
    - How far the light propagates in space.
    - Lighting falloff is quadratic with no hard limit/cutoff, so this property dictates the point at which the light's intensity will be 10%. See {@link scene/nodes/PointLightNode.PointLightNode.range range} for more details.

#### Directional lights
Directional lights can be added to a scene with {@link scene/nodes/DirectionalLightNode.DirectionalLightNode DirectionalLightNode}. Directional lights emit light in a direction, with no specific position. They aren't like "spotlights" seen in other engines, they're more like light from the sun - visible everywhere from the same direction. Directional lights have the following properties:
  - {@link scene/nodes/DirectionalLightNode.DirectionalLightNode.color color}
    - The color of the light.
  - {@link scene/nodes/DirectionalLightNode.DirectionalLightNode.intensity intensity}
    - Scalar multiplier for the light's brightness between 0 and 1.

A directional light's direction is determined by its {@link transform/Transform.Transform Transform}. By default, a {@link scene/nodes/DirectionalLightNode.DirectionalLightNode DirectionalLightNode} shines along {@link math/Vector3.Vector3.forward Vector3.forward()}.

```typescript
const sun = new DirectionalLightNode(scene, 'sun', { color: Color3.white() })
// Point light straight down
sun.rotation.x = -90;
```

#### **Config**

The lighting system in LoPoly can be configured as part of the {@link Engine.Engine Engine} construction:

```typescript
const engine = new Engine(canvas, fileSystem, {
  lighting: {
    maxPointLights: 8,
    // ...
  }
});
```

The following options are available:

| Option | Description | Default |
| ------ | ----------- | ------- |
| maxPointLights | Maximum number of point lights active in the scene. | 4 |
| defaultPointLightRange | Default range used in creation of point lights when no range option specified. | 10 |
| maxDirectionalLights | Maximum number of directional lights active in the scene. | 2 |

### Input handling

LoPoly supports many forms of input including gamepads, keyboard, and pointer devices (e.g. mouse, or touch input).

#### Inputs and Input Bindings

The input system is based around the concept of _Inputs_ which are labels given to controls in your game (e.g. `jump`, `player:x`, `back`, etc). An input can be defined as either a `button` or an `axis` type. Buttons are discrete inputs that are either on or off, and axes are continuous inputs that can be polled for their current value. A typical example of a button type input would be a pause button that opens the menu, and a typical example of an axis type input would be the horizontal component of the player's movement.

Inputs can't do anything without _Input Bindings_ which tie inputs to the controls on a physical device such as {@link input/enum/KeyCode.KeyCode KeyCode.KeyW}, {@link input/enum/GamepadAxis.GamepadAxis GamepadAxis.JoyRightX} or {@link input/enum/MouseButton.MouseButton MouseButton.Left}.

Even though input bindings tend to function naturally as either a button or an axis, any input binding can be used for either type. Analog bindings can be bound to a button input (e.g. using an analog gamepad trigger like a button), and a pair of buttons can be bound to an axis input (e.g. using the arrow keys on a keyboard like a movement axis).

#### Configuring inputs

Inputs and input bindings can be configured all at once by calling {@link input/InputSystem.InputSystem.configure InputSystem.configure()}:

```typescript
const { inputSystem: input } = engine;

input.configure({
  buttons: [
    {
      name: 'player:jump',
      bindings: [
        KeyCode.Space,
        GamepadButton.South,
      ],
    },
    // ...
  ],
  axes: [
    {
      name: 'player:x',
      bindings: [
        { min: KeyCode.KeyA, max: KeyCode.KeyD },
        GamepadAxis.JoyLeftX,
      ],
    },
    {
      name: 'player:y',
      bindings: [
        { min: KeyCode.KeyS, max: KeyCode.KeyW },
        GamepadAxis.JoyLeftY,
      ],
    },
    // ...
  ],
});
```

Inputs and input bindings can be updated at any time:

```typescript
// Add a new input
input.addInput({
  type: 'button',
  name: 'player:shoot',
  bindings: [MouseButton.Left, GamepadButton.R2],
});
// Remove an input
input.removeInput('button', 'menu:accept');

// Add a set of input bindings to an input
input.addInputBinding({
  type: 'button',
  name: 'player:boost',
  bindings: [GamepadButton.South],
});
// Remove a set of input bindings from an input
input.removeInputBinding({
  type: 'button',
  name: 'player:shoot',
  bindings: [GamepadButton.R2],
});
```

Calling these methods updates the current input config, whereas calling {@link input/InputSystem.InputSystem.configure InputSystem.configure()} replaces it.

The following inputs are configured by default:

| Type   | Name       | Bindings                                                                                                  |
| ------ | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Button | `jump`     | `KeyCode.Space` <br> `GamepadButton.South`                                                                |
| Button | `action`   | `KeyCode.KeyF` <br> `GamepadButton.West`                                                                  |
| Axis   | `player:x` | `GamepadAxis.JoyLeftX` <br> `[KeyCode.KeyA, KeyCode.KeyD]` <br> `[KeyCode.ArrowLeft, KeyCode.ArrowRight]` |
| Axis   | `player:y` | `GamepadAxis.JoyLeftY` <br> `[KeyCode.KeyS, KeyCode.KeyW]` <br> `[KeyCode.ArrowDown, KeyCode.ArrowUp]`    |

#### Input devices

The following types of input device are supported:

**Keyboard**
- Input bindings are specified using {@link input/enum/KeyCode.KeyCode KeyCode}.
- Only 1 keyboard input is supported at a time.

**Gamepad**
- Input bindings are specified using {@link input/enum/GamepadButton.GamepadButton GamepadButton} or {@link input/enum/GamepadAxis.GamepadAxis GamepadAxis}.
- Multiple gamepads are supported at a time. See [Multiple players](#multiple-players).
- Any device that is detected by browsers as a [Standard Gamepad](https://w3c.github.io/gamepad/#dfn-standard-gamepad) is supported. This should include any modern gaming console controller.

**Pointer (mouse and touch)**
- Input bindings are specified using {@link input/enum/MouseButton.MouseButton MouseButton} and {@link input/enum/MouseWheelDirection.MouseWheelDirection MouseWheelDirection}.
- Touch inputs are registered as `MouseButton.Left`.
- For simplicity, the Pointer device can only be assigned to a player in tandem with the keyboard device. A player cannot be assigned gamepad + pointer. See [Multiple players](#multiple-players).
- **Note** that {@link input/enum/MouseWheelDirection.MouseWheelDirection MouseWheelDirection} events DO NOT fire `released` events - they are instantaneous inputs only.

#### Button inputs

Button type inputs are discrete - they're either pressed or not pressed. To check the state of a button you can call {@link input/InputSystem.IInputSystem.isButtonDown isButtonDown()}:

```typescript
const isPressingJump = input.isButtonDown('player:jump');
```

Often times, however, you want to perform some logic when the state of a button _changes_. To support this, LoPoly exposes the following functions:

```typescript
const wasJumpPressed = input.wasButtonPressed('player:jump');
const wasJumpReleased = input.wasButtonReleased('player:jump');
```

These functions return `true` only on the frame that the input was pressed / released.

If you want to use the value of a button in an equation (e.g. to multiply the speed of something by the value of a button), you can call {@link input/InputSystem.IInputSystem.getButtonValue getButtonValue()}:

```typescript
// Note: An Axis type input would be better suited for this specific scenario
const speedLeft = input.getButtonValue('player:move.left');
const speedRight = input.getButtonValue('player:move.right');
player.position.x += (speedRight - speedLeft) * PlayerSpeed;
```

{@link input/InputSystem.IInputSystem.getButtonValue getButtonValue()} returns `1` if the button is pressed, or `0` otherwise.

Button inputs can be defined as follows:

```typescript
input.addInput({
  name: 'player:jump',
  type: 'button',
  bindings: [
    // Discrete inputs
    KeyCode.Space,
    GamepadButton.South,
    // Analog input configured as a button (i.e. Pressing "up" on the left joystick)
    {
      axis: GamepadAxis.JoyLeftY,
      direction: 'positive',
    },
  ],
});
```

When using an analog input binding as a button, the threshold for determining whether an axis is "pressed" is based on {@link input/InputSystem.IInputSystem.analogButtonPressedThreshold InputSystem.analogButtonPressedThreshold}, which can be configured:

```typescript
// Default value is 0.2
input.analogButtonPressedThreshold = 0.1;
```

#### Axis inputs

Axis type inputs are continuous - they are represented by a value between `-1` and `1`. To get the value of an axis you can call {@link input/InputSystem.IInputSystem.getAxisValue getAxisValue()}:

```typescript
const playerXInput = input.getAxisValue('player:x');
player.position.x += playerXInput
```

Axis inputs can be defined as follows:

```typescript
input.addInput({
  name: 'player:x',
  type: 'axis',
  bindings: [
    // Analog input
    GamepadAxis.JoyLeftX,
    // Discrete inputs configured as an axis
    {
      min: KeyCode.KeyA, max: KeyCode.KeyD,
    },
  ],
});
```

When using discrete input bindings as an axis, pressing `min` will return `-1`, pressing `max` will return `1`, and pressing both (or neither) will return `0`.

Axis inputs have a configurable "deadzone" wherein their value will be rounded to `0` if the absolute value of the axis is less than the deadzone threshold. This can be configured:

```typescript
// Default value is 0.1
input.axisDeadZone = 0.2;
```

#### Pointer input

LoPoly supports reading input from a pointer device (e.g. mouse or touch input). This is a secondary type of input that represents a position on the screen. You can read the pointer input state by calling {@link input/InputSystem.IInputSystem.getPointer getPointer()}:

```typescript
const pointerState = input.getPointer();
```

{@link input/InputSystem.IInputSystem.getPointer getPointer()} returns a {@link input/InputSystem.PointerState PointerState} object which has properties like {@link input/InputSystem.PointerState.x x} and {@link input/InputSystem.PointerState.y y} specifying the pointer's position on the screen in pixels. The pointer state also has delta properties {@link input/InputSystem.PointerState.xDelta xDelta} and {@link input/InputSystem.PointerState.yDelta yDelta} which represent how many pixels the pointer has moved since the previous frame. Pointer coordinates are relative to the top-left of the game canvas.

The pointer can also be "locked" which hides the cursor (if present) and prevents it from leaving the game canvas area. This is usually used for e.g. controlling a camera, where having a physical cursor on the screen is not desirable.

```typescript
// Lock the pointer
input.lockPointer();

// Release pointer lock
input.releasePointer();
```

Locking the pointer often requires some input from the user so it might not lock immediately on calling {@link input/InputSystem.InputSystem.lockPointer lockPointer()}. In this scenario it will be locked as soon as the player performs a pointer interaction (usually clicking on the game canvas).

#### Multiple players

LoPoly supports assigning different input devices to different players for creating multiplayer games. By default, all input devices are assigned to player 0 - the default player that is read when calling input methods like {@link input/InputSystem.IInputSystem.wasButtonPressed wasButtonPressed()}.

A specific input device can be assigned to a player by calling {@link input/InputSystem.IInputSystem.assignInputDeviceToPlayer assignInputDeviceToPlayer()}:

```typescript
// Assign keyboard+mouse input device to player 2 (which has player index 1)
input.assignInputDeviceToPlayer(1, KeyboardAndMouseDeviceId);
```

Assigning the Keyboard & Mouse input device is straightforward since there can only be 1 of these "devices" connected. However, assigning a gamepad requires a gamepad index parameter:

```typescript
// Assign gamepad with index 2 to player 1
// NOTE: There is an easier way to do this, see `listenForDevices()` below
input.assignInputDeviceToPlayer(0, gamepadIndexToDeviceId(2));
```

This gamepad index parameter is generally an arbitrary number with no bearing on the device to which it relates. To make it easier for developers to build user interfaces that map physical devices to input device IDs, LoPoly exposes a function called {@link input/InputSystem.IInputSystem.listenForDevices listenForDevices()}:

```typescript
// Start listening for input from all devices
input.listenForDevices((inputDeviceId) => {
  // ...
});
```

While this function is active, it's called every time any input is pressed on any device. The parameter is the input device ID on which the input was pressed. This can be used to assign input devices to players:
<!-- @TODO need to dogfood this i'm sure it doesn't quite work well -->

```typescript
const assignedDevices = new Set<InputDeviceId>();
let currentPlayer = 0;
input.listenForDevices((inputDeviceId) => {
  if (!assignedDevices.has(inputDeviceId)) {
    const player = currentPlayer++;
    assignedDevices.add(inputDeviceId);
    // Assign input device to player X
    input.assignInputDeviceToPlayer(player, inputDeviceId);

    // (Example) Show on the UI that player X was assigned device Y (e.g. keyboard / gamepad)
    ui.setPlayerDevice(player, inputDeviceId.type);

    // Stop listening once all players have been assigned
    if (currentPlayer >= MaxPlayers) {
      input.stopListeningForDevices();
    }
  }
});
```

If you are familiar with Nintendo Switch, this allows you to build a system very similar to their player-assigning screen. This is the preferred way to assign input devices since it is more natural for players and easier to code (requiring no reference to specific input device IDs).

Once all players have been assigned input devices, you can stop listening for inputs with {@link input/InputSystem.IInputSystem.stopListeningForDevices stopListeningForDevices()}:

```typescript
input.stopListeningForDevices();
```

Querying for input when dealing with multiple players is simple. All the normal functions take an optional `playerNumber` parameter:

```typescript
// Player 1 pressed button
input.wasButtonPressed('player:jump', 0);
// Player 2 released button
input.wasButtonReleased('player:jump', 1);
// Player 3 is holding button
input.isButtonDown('player:attack', 2);
// Player 4 state of button
input.getButtonValue('player:strum', 3);
// Player 2 state of axis
input.getAxisValue('player:x', 1);
// etc.
```
